- `aggGP.ipynb`: code for the AggGP model.
- `aggVAE_indiv.ipynb`:  code for teh AggVAE model applied to administrative units 1 and 2 separately.
- `aggCVAE_gpu_indiv_admin.ipynb`: code for the AggCVAE model applied administrative units 1 and 2 separately.
- `aggCVAE_all_admin.ipynb`:  code for the AggCVAE model encoding administrative units 1 and 2 jointly.
- `aggCVAE_thesis_figures.ipynb`: code to produce comparison plots between aggVAE, aggCVAE and aggGP in the thesis.
